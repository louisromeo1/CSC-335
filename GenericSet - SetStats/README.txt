Description: Program is a result of two assignments, GenericSet and SetStats. Firstly, we are tasked with creating a GenericSet using Test-Driven Development (TDD) which requires writing out testcases before the actual implementation. SetStats uses the GenericSet model and creates an event-driven program with a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI allows for entering a number and shows the statistics of the set including maximum, minimum, and mean of the data.
